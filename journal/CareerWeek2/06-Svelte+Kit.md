Prisma as ORM

Front-end framework SIMILAR to Vue

Vercel hired out all Svelte - technically open source, but all by Vercel, now

Is a compiler - low bundle sizes and faster load times
Bypasses virtual DOM

Built in features like animation, storage - power a reactive global state

Simple syntax JS w/ special decorators

"Web dev w/o the hassle"

All variables are reactive, simple computed state, binding is reactive - both ways!
