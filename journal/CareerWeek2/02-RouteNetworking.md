# Resume building
NOT a summary of your job descriptions
The GOAL is to highlight your achievements and impact
    - how did your presence make an impact
    - Quant and qual points
    - money/time saved
Professional bragging paper
State #clients served, goals achieved (all surveys met)
    - % are your friend
    - # can be subjective

Also

Obj:
Skills - hard
Skills - soft
Real projects
Hx

START DOING SIDE WORK
    -Coursera, etc., to continue advancing

Open AI your resume

ONE PAGE
    - or AT LEAST front load (i.e. references on second page)
HYPERLINK your Github in the PDF (do not need full line, hyperlink "github" vs your full URL)

PDF - all the way

# Networking building
Elevator pitch
    - make them wish you didn't step off when you did

Swing a pitch in any environment
    - engaging, hook a person - be interested in them, but also flex you
    - room reading ability

Your hook - coffee or LinkedIn connection request

NEVER trail off
    -repeat answer back, "did I clarify that for you", "did that make sense"

* Interview dress - feel free to ask about appropriate attire for your interview process or job

ASSUME business professional or MAYBE business casual
Iron or dry clean your outfit
Always be on video first
    - if they cut video, ask if you can, but expect no
    - blur your background
    -practice getting on the platform

# LinkedIn building
Be yourself, creative, useful
Send intentional requests to connect on LinkedIn

# STAR Method Interviewing building
Before any interview:
You have resume, and a list of go-to stories
    - i.e. for overcoming something difficult (work or edu)
    - Have at least 3 stories for main STAR questions

Situation, Task, Action, Result
S: Set the scene
T: Describe your responsibility
A: Explain your exact steps in addressing situation
R: Share the outcomes of your actions

NO $ questions on first interview

Need to answer salary question if you get it
    - ask about their range or budget they have in mind
    - state the range of positions you have applied for and your desire to stay within that range
    - asking low will make you look bad, too
    - benefits: overtime or 401k, health insurance
    - do not list the high end
