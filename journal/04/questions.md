# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Synchronous code runs automatically, whereas asynchronous code does not. Instead, prefixing a function with async requires terms and conditions be met before the next lines run. |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | Event listeners are the bobbers of coding, where once the event is triggered, additional actions are performed. A benefit of event listeners is that they can be stacked. |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | Representational State Transfer. REST design is a manner of framing data so that it can be handled regardless of the language and system accessing it. It is foundational to the general ability to successfully search the web. |

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | Callbacks are functions nested in functions. They run after the function they are in has been triggered. |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise is a necessary aspect of ansynchronous coding in that it plays proxy for an unknown value, resulting in a dessert fork of states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Promises have a catch() block, wherein you can console log the code as a parameter, identifying the issue. |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | Are these the CRUD things? So get, post, and delete count? |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application Programming Interface |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | Awaits have to be part of async functions, because they imply a non-synchronous - asynchronous - running of the code.  |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | Encapsulation is wrapping your dog's medicine in cheese so that they take it. The user get access to the goods without being able to tamper with them. |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200. Do pass "Go", do collect 200. |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | A 400 error means the server cannot work with the request - likely for client-side error where the request is mis-formatted. The http.cat cat is not happy with you. |
