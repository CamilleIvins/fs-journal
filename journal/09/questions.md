# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> | Inheritance is how to pass down functionality down from existing objects to those nested within them. As part of object-oriented programming, it helps produce cleaner code. |

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> | Singleton design holds a single instance of a class - no more. It has some benefit in that it can be accessed anywhere in an application, and I believe an example of this is how there can only be one 'Account', when a person logs in, despite an application being able to track multiple users. |

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> | Obeserver design is used to support aleting multiple objects of a change in whatever it is they are observing. There are issues here when not every change is relevant to every observer, and that can bog down an application. |

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> | Strategy design operates using a high-level deployment of multiple objects. These objects are child elements, subject to the parameters of the initial methods. |

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> | Factory design focuses on the how of creating objects, with no particular eye for the specifics, which are designed in a subclass. These are our controllers extending the BaseController. Each instance created carries a level of the logic from the BaseController. |

06. What is test driven development?

> | This seems to me the code equivalent of measure twice, cut once. Test cases are developed before any feature is formally witten. |

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> | Standing for 'definition of done', DoD is where the minimum viable product and minimum viable satisfaction align for a development team. This measures the "completeness" of backlog items, ensuring that features are not passed along until the quality meets the expectations of the product owner and team. |

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> | As a banana word, supercalifragilisticexpialidcious wishes to keep track of the number of shorter words it is replacing, and compare them to the list of longer words it is replacing.

As a competative speedwalker, I want to know the change of pace when I take corners so that I know where I can best shave off time. |

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> | Ideally, the sprint planning sessions is where this matter of backlog creation is handled. Given the way progress and updates happen, the sessions ought to be repeated, ensuring the team can keep up with the progress of the features delivered and desired. |

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> | Sprint planning is also the time when assignments are divided. Teams take responsibility for the backlog items so that the desired tasks can all get done. |
