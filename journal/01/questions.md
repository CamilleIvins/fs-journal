# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Git is a great way to push code to a source control |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | "mkdir" makes a new folder or directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A pseudo-class combines the stylization of a class selector with another class facet often specific to user interaction. I expect that I would use it frequently when designing forms, since it sounds like they can make them more user-friendly. |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity is a way for CSS elements to be scaled according to importance, so that certain styling can or cannot be over-ridden by others, depending on the desired look or interaction. I think specificity will come in handy when trying to maintain a page's visual continuity while creating contrast within various elements, whether that is different colors for text in a sidebar or aligning pictures. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | I can see it become more difficult to manage alterations from existing code that has too many "!important" features. If a page is perfectly tailored with them, but needs to be debugged or updated, it is possible that levels of specificity are not aligned to their loss. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | h1 is the selector - identifying what is to be affected by CSS, color is the property of the selector being targeted for styling, and rgba(255, 210, 33, .75) is the value assigned to the property. |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Calmness is an overarching experience that can be provided through good design. Prospective purchasers of goods and services are not aiming to feel exasperated by tedious navigation, irriated by pop-ups, or stressed by poor color contrast, and mistakes in this area can be interpreted as a lack of professionalism. Design can convey confidence or spiritedness as much as dodginess or afterthought. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | A wireframe lays out the overall composition a web page is expected to have, serving as a blueprint of sorts. A good wireframe has the elements laid out, though not fleshed out. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | As a beginner, I definitely see use in having a wireframe. Moving forward, I can see the nature of a wireframe perhaps changing moreso than becoming obsolete. Much like an essay outline, learning the path from intro to conclusion is not to wax poetic on the 5-paragraph composition piece, but to bring about better understanding between two people, as long as that purpose is being fulfilled, wireframe are worth the effort. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | Presently the bane of my existence? Ideally, the flex property display will adjust the length of items within a container when the overall screen parameters change. If not adjusted, an element may disappear, grow to cover the page, or otherwise force the page elements out of alignment. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Too many. There can be changes with margins or gaps, the alignment can be altered by the number of elements combined in a row - and how they are combined - or the content within can force a change in the size. |
