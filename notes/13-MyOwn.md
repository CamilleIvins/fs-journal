Saying I'm sorry I misunderstood you or you misunderstood me seems poor form for the ways I've clearly hurt you,
    as if I am saying it must just suck to be you at this moment, that it's your problem not mine
        or some other form of fake validation.
    I do feel bad.
After all this though, we both want to stop feeling hurt, so I am unsure of how warranted being sorry is.
    In the long run, being sorru is for building a joint future,
        otherwise it is just hauling worthless guilt that requires stepping into some other broken scenario to get removed.
            if our best solution is retraction, you can't hold that over me. I refuse.

And yes, I do want to know hw this will likely pan out, how you think it will pan out,
    that is the way I think of a lot of areas where I devote time and effort.
        More so, now.
            Every friendship where I cry in ront of someone ends within a year
                empathy never leads to positive change,
                    so I am more inclined to know your thoughts and expectations now than just wait for what seems like the inevitable.
            I see a beautiful, towering boundary between us that will easily last.
                No light will get in, and nothing will ever grow,
                    but it will be safe, predictable, and agreed upon.
                            That's all we seem to be able to build in our attempts to repair or realign.
                I have a great friend where our thing is we share poetry and architecture,
                    that's how we continue to move towards one another.
                        We can just do that until we have better proof we can trust one another.
                            Until then, we cannot miscommunicate to this degree and still take each other at our words.
                                The last time you expressed interest in my thoughts you proved entirely untrustworthy,
                                    and I doubt I am seen much different, at this point.
                    Everything I say is a full scale assault on where you are supposed to be secure in yourself,
                        and you only pursue to speak a knife when I'm broken,
                            so we are caught in a terrible hunt.

I tried explaining myself,
    using as tame, but precise, clarifications as I could about what I thought was a skewering negative perception of
        pretty much everyone
            which came across not as coming from a position of processing or
                complaining
            but as putting others under heel until you thought you sounded too cruel and rolled it back.
    So take that the only description of Sakan I heard was that he's a whiny bitch for missing his wife,
        and that his place of work,
            a place which represents a lifetime of amazing skill and social hospitality,
        is closed? Yeah,
            it stopped sounding like teasing. it sounded like your reality.
    I still did not see this as some fundamental problem of you,
        just a cultural hangover - 
            everything can look like griping to people who work in war zones, and while soldiers get to have discrete lives,
                NGO selection bias towards civilian workers and living makes them very stable cultures,
                    obviously regardless of health, that foster a sense of constant triage.
        Beyond that, it seemed shocking in that it did not represent you as I had grown to know you,
            your aims and what you believe about people
                (it sounded a lot like your complaints with FBR culture)
                    and I failed to intepret that as a cue you were trusting me.
                        In trying to hold that separation, it sounded patronizing,
                            underhanded, and certainly not healthy, but I never saw that as reflecting something
                                about you as a person, I just don't see actions that way,
                                    certainly not when I think someone's actual thoughts are different.

You explained your intentions and I updated my priors - and it resulted in this,
    and I cannot really get over it.
        I just stare at it and wonder why I couldn't just let you have the last word, just let you think what you want.
You said at the very start that it would be a better use of you time being direct instead of validating me,
    I've not read anything since   with the perspective that you wanted anything else,
        and tried to be efficient - set very narrow subject parameters for my thought.
            Rooting out bad perceptions  means focusing on what needs to go, feelings were only expressed insofar as
                I expected they needed to change
                    but I definitely thought we had a different understanding of the foundations -- so this is too far
    I was just grateful you were open to doing this at all - I know you said it isn't your preferred style,
        that it's too involved,
    but still moved forward pretty hurt.
        Was I really supposed to feel comfortable when I had listened to yoou validate the feelings of
            pretty much any person or animal:
    All the way from peopl you went through the  most formative years and critical hardships with,
    and animals you raised almost from birth,
        to scripted TV pedophiles and animals who sent you to the ER,
            and somehow I didn't land anywhere on that spectrum?
Nothing I do has meaning. Yeah, sure my building capabilities suck.
    The frames are trash.
        It would still help if I wasn't building on quicksand. You asked for any tips,
            I thought I was giving you one, and readjusted when I saw I was wrong, but it just made things worse.
Psychologically, I'd be better off if I just agreed with you and wrote you off a hypocrite,
    it would be enough that I knew the truth.
        I told you outright what I think of you, that I don't think poorly of you,
            that I never have.
    I thought I'd said studd like that the whole time we had been friends.
        I value your heart, it's daring, you engage with some really complex crises in our world,
            and a delight because you still try to be free in whatever life throws at you.
        You're kind of a badass in everything you pursue.
            I think your mind is exquisite,
                often a charming mystery.
                    You exhibit the intangible qualities that make people glad you walk the earth before they even know you,
                        and it is backed up by people still desiring more of you in the world after they get to know you.

Even if I did choose to perseverate on negative character for kicks, I wouldn't really care,
    I have never let them stop friendships before,
     but when those thoughts came up I wrestled with them until they left defeated because I knew it was important
        To you that people not see you on the ways you associate with peopel who traumatized you,
            and I knew they were inaccurate tpo what I'd known before.
                I reached the point where I could just acknowledge and then dismiss them if they try.
                    But I left broken by certain phrases and actions that came across to me as warnings and worse.

    Should I have bullet pointed them instead? All of this absolutely looks to have been the worse option.

        Yes, I went through this under misuderstandings, thinking that it was still not a good use of your time to validate me,
            and that it was intrusive to your life.
        You had told me that while you are very specific in what you let in, you broadcast out,
            so I was not aware that when you were speaking to me you were doing so on a level of confidence not granted others,
                it came across that how you spoke of people to me was how you did so to anyone.
        You said you don't need to believe people to walk with them,
            and I have tried to work with our different understandings of trust so that can be possible.

                I was not thinking this would deteriorate.

I can see where when all of this is not true,
    then I have been extremely hurtful.
I was trying to move through this quickly and in the manner I did because, again,
    I had the wrong perspective in the initial steps forward.
And it's been hurtful for me trying to not say anything that came off as needing validation,
    that reveals brokenness and outright flaws and fragility that I can put up with being broadcast to others,
        and that conforms to believing your words and actions when you dont have to believe mine,
            while still getting to the problems I've been having.
    Still, within all that I went into this with the hope that I'll be trying to get closer to you, the real you,
        that things will end up better,
            that the solution is to confront waht is hurting and move past it.
I do not bring these things up to keep negative anything towards you valid,
    I can deal with the thoughts,
        and do not think that the feelings are anything to be approved of, either.
            I've just been hurt in ways that makes you unsafe to me,
                and I wanted that to change.
        That's why I addressed you.
            I didn't want things to be as good as they could be, but decidely worse than before.
                No matter how wrong I've percieved your actions and words,
                    taking you at your word meant I had to cover, hedge, and not raise concerns,
        and holding onto truth when your whole sensory system is of fire saying the opposite causes problems.

I did not grow up with that culture of Christian niceties,
    I am on pretty much everyone I talk to's record for saying
unconditional love is bull - as well as unbiblical, and a counselling hack from the 70s -
    specifically because it welcomes abuse,
        and I can only imagine how devestating that has been
            to inhabit a world that lives that principle out as problems between people snowball,
                and various persons take advantage of this to cause even more hurt.
        I only get it to the degree that I understand people are not trustworthy.
The culture I had I suppose could be termed "Christian consequences",
    but consequences are just how more regimented societies and authoritative countries work, regardless.
I've worked hard to get out of that, though,
    because it's really hard on people,
        Americans in particular,
            and I have ample ecperiences messing up because I just find a ton of things way more serious than others.
    I wanted to be considerate, and remained so until I thought your purposes could be too deliberately harmful to me,
        so I started all this,
            and have tried to explain
                why I have trouble matching what I trusted about you with how you behave,
                    why affirmations ring hollow,
                        why that now causes me to have concerns that did not exist before.
    Your complaint on how you are being seen has been mine,
        and after all this, I do not see the point in trying when everything gets so much worse for it.
    Your commitment to leave this culture of niceness, or your expectations for what it should bring about,
        seem equally questionable as any of my efforts in this.
            If you are wanting credit for this,
                yet are unwilling to submit yourself to these new standards when holding them against others,
            then, sure, you would be a classical hypocrite in the Greek, or whatever,
                but what makes you think I'm supposed to be happy or something to point that out?
                    What good is it to criticise people for wanting better?
                        Anyone who wishes for good things they don't yet have,
                            and aspires to the behaviour they associate with it
                                still is pursuing good.
                                    It's good that you want to be free to bring these issues up without retailiation.
                    I really don't know where this leaves us though.
                        Naming bad things just seems to be giving them power, here
                            not dissolving them.
            I knew I came into this hurt, but I have not used anything I know or experienced of you to knowingly push you away,
                and I hate that I have to reconsider the wisdom of this.
                    I tried to admit where I've been wrong to move toward you,
                        but each time it doesn't make up for the distance I bring when I raise concerns and anxieties in the first place.

If I thought poorly of you to your core
    I would not have even bothered talking to you after I left Thailand;
        while I do find it a virtue to cover the gaps left by differences between persons and their cultures,
            I am not that self-hating.
        All my American life I have  dealt with perfectly kind people like you who are all about appropriate action and being,
            and so the only appropriate place to turn anger and hurt that inspire unapproved action is inward.
                To do self work,
                    which really just results in self-harm.
                        I am sick of relational problems always just being single responsibility.
                            It doesn't work that way unless you go into it knowing that people can and will change in response.
                                It creates shitty people, or
                                    better people who still get treated like shit,
                                        and I'm done thinking that the expectation otherwise is anything but corporate positivism,
                                            that all things must be perfect transactions, so if something is wrong, you must be using bad bills.
                        You praise strong boundaries, and this is where mine start.
                            If this is just on me and my perceptions, then you can't tell me how you are to people,
                                and expect me to just nod and agree, anymore.
    The incongruity of what you want to be to people - which I believe is sincere -
        and what I felt you were to me, not you yourself, is the root.
            I have been trying to uproot it, but I just take out anything good with it, apparently.
                If your identity is so bound up in how you are seen by people, then we are going to have trouble.
                    I cannot as easily escape that now I stay stuck in a deep sense of panic after I interact with you,
                        that I'm usually in tears after,
                            and that it's only been this way since May.

                    Amazingly, this is worse now than after I left.

                                I just wanted to be safe again, I got angry for the same reason you did at me,
                                    and was willing to do the work to change,
                                        but I don't know it that is something I want, now.
                                            

Neither of us can really do this.
    We're just setting each other off in turn.

I think you are right that your knowledge of yourself
    and my experience of you,
my experience of myself and your understanding of me.
    and vise-versa,
        do not seem compatible for much beyond pictures of plants and food.
            If those concepts are what we hold most true of one another,
                if I've just been repressing how I must truly see you,
                    I cannot read this and see anything else being reasonable,
                        and we will both be healthier if we can hold views of one another more consistent with our percieved treatment,
                            and re-center how we relate on to topics that cannot be hurtful.
                    We have reached the point where we cannot even share humour, which is probably the best at surviving electronic communication intact -
                        though I do still believe our styles are similar, parallel tracks ever meet, and even that can just cause more problems.
            We do not appear to actually be able to keep what is being said from transforming into a full indictment on
                one another's character and senses of self.
            We have become predators towards one another in very specific ways,
                and it is unclear to me whether or not dealing with it will resolve,
                    rather than exacerbate,
                        the problem.
                This was not what I thought would happen, though
                    and I thought I was showing the tenacity and trust for things to go beyond this type of misunderstanding,
                        but you didn't seem to want that, so I backed off,
                            and that again made things worse.
                                I expect you feel the same.
So what now?
    The only way to escape a self-fulfilling prophecy is to never have it spoken to begin with.
        It seems like each conclusion is to just will and trust for less than what could have been there had I never spoken up.
